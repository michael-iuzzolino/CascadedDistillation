# Improving Anytime Prediction with Parallel Cascaded Networks and a Temporal-Difference Loss

---

This repo provides code from the Improving Anytime Prediction with Parallel Cascaded Networks and a Temporal-Difference Loss [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09808). We provide implementation of:

  * Our training procedure on HowTo100M for learning a joint text-video embedding
  * Our evaluation code on MSR-VTT, YouCook2 and LSMDC for Text-to-Video retrieval
  * A pretrain model on HowTo100M
  * Feature extraction from raw videos script we used
  * More information about HowTo100M can be found on the project webpage: https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/howto100m/
